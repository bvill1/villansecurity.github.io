    This site is more than a r√©sum√©; it's a full cybersecurity showcase, built from scratch using GitHub Pages, Jekyll, and the Spectral theme. Designed for clarity, stealth aesthetics, and real-world engagement, the site incorporates personal branding, red/blue team content, project documentation, and embedded detection mechanisms. It's both a storytelling platform and a live operational artifact.

  <h2>Stealth Web-Based Canary Trap</h2>
  <div class="project-meta">
    <span class="project-tags">#websecurity #detection #osint</span>
    <span class="project-date">March 2025</span>
  </div>
  <p class="project-description">
    This project implements a passive, stealth-based canary trap using a 1x1 transparent image embedded in a public-facing cert showcase. The trap silently triggers when a visitor loads the page, logging metadata (IP, UA, referer) to a Discord webhook for real-time alerting.

  <p class="project-description">
    This project combines real-time social media scraping, AI-driven sentiment analysis, and visual reporting to track public chatter around a target organization or topic. Built with Python and Streamlit, it ingests Twitter, Reddit, and RSS news content and generates dashboards, word clouds, keyword charts, and PDF reports. Sentiment scoring leverages GPT-based language models for nuanced analysis across platforms.
