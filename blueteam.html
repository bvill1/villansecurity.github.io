      <p>Cybersecurity isn’t just about firewalls and logs — it’s about protecting people, systems, and mission-critical processes from real harm. My background in emergency response taught me that clarity, speed, and trust are essential under pressure. I bring that same mindset into every defensive engagement I lead.</p>

      <h3 style="border-left: 4px solid #0077cc; padding-left: 0.6em;"><span class="icon fa-envelope"></span> Email Security</h3>
      <p>I manage the full stack — from secure gateways to M365 hardening. I tune rulesets, enforce policies, and monitor mail flow behaviors to proactively detect impersonation and payload-based threats. From detection to user education, I handle every aspect of phishing defense.</p>

        <p>Defense is more than tools — it's calm clarity in moments of chaos. Here's how I respond when it counts.</p>

            <h4>🔗 Credential Phishing Campaign</h4>
            <p>A multi-user phishing attempt triggered elevated login risk indicators. I isolated impacted users, reviewed login metadata, reset MFA, and traced the lure to a compromised third-party site. I tuned detections and led a company-wide awareness update within 24 hours.</p>

            <h4>📩 Insider Email Impersonation</h4>
            <p>A convincing spoof email tried to initiate wire fraud. I inspected headers, identified a spoofed vendor, blocked the domain, and followed up with internal education and sender authentication policy adjustments.</p>

            <h4>⚙️ OT/IT Segmentation Response</h4>
            <p>Scanning activity from an IT host near OT assets raised red flags. I validated network paths, confirmed it was a misconfigured monitor, then proposed enhanced firewall segmentation and traffic rules to leadership.</p>

        <h3 style="border-left: 4px solid #0077cc; padding-left: 0.6em;"><span class="icon fa-compass"></span> Defensive Philosophy</h3>
        <p>Every control, every script, every email I secure — it’s not just about uptime. It’s about protecting the mission and the people behind it.</p>
      </header>

      <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #0077cc; padding-left: 1em; font-style: italic;">
        “Defense isn't just a job. It's a discipline — and a responsibility.”
      </blockquote>

      <p>My approach is rooted in service. I protect systems because they power missions. I investigate not just to find answers, but to keep people safe and informed. Whether I’m triaging phishing attempts, configuring mail flow, or writing detection logic, I treat it with purpose.</p>

      <p>Coming from physical security and EMS, I’ve lived the stakes of getting it right under pressure. I bring that urgency and clarity to every control, alert, and strategy conversation I enter.</p>
