      <h3>Defense with Purpose</h3>
      <p>Cybersecurity isn’t just about firewalls and logs — it’s about protecting people, systems, and mission-critical processes from real harm. My background in emergency response taught me that clarity, speed, and trust are essential under pressure. I bring that same mindset into every defensive engagement I lead.</p>

      <h3>My Areas of Focus</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Phishing Defense:</strong> I investigate dozens of phishing attempts daily, validate payloads, and tune detections. I run end-user simulations, improve reporting culture, and build awareness campaigns grounded in real-world attacks.</li>
        <li><strong>Email Security:</strong> I manage the full stack — from secure email gateways to M365 hardening and mail flow rules. I design layered defenses with DMARC, SPF, DKIM, impersonation controls, and anomaly-based detection.</li>
        <li><strong>Incident Response:</strong> I lead alert triage, coordinate across teams, and guide the response cycle from identification through containment and lessons learned. Whether it's endpoint compromise or insider threats, I respond with clarity and control.</li>
        <li><strong>Security Engineering:</strong> I actively collaborate on infrastructure projects, infusing security into AD hardening, virtual environments, and Microsoft cloud services. I validate technical controls and audit them against emerging risks.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How I Work</h3>
      <p>I believe defenders should think like attackers — not to break things, but to build them stronger. I study offensive tactics so I can anticipate them. I test detections in lab environments. I believe in purple team collaboration, not siloed teams.</p>

      <p>My job isn’t just to block threats — it’s to understand them, communicate risk clearly, and help the business make smarter security decisions. I don’t just chase alerts; I tune out the noise, dig into root causes, and leave each system better than I found it.</p>

      <h3>Tools in My Kit</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>SIEM:</strong> Alert tuning, custom rule creation, and correlation analysis</li>
        <li><strong>EDR/XDR:</strong> Investigation, containment, response workflow design</li>
        <li><strong>M365 Defender Suite:</strong> Email, endpoint, identity, and cloud app protection</li>
        <li><strong>Phishing Simulation:</strong> Custom campaigns and targeted user training</li>
        <li><strong>Threat Hunting:</strong> IOC correlation, pattern recognition, and proactive sweeps</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Always Improving</h3>
      <p>Every phishing ticket, every false positive, every gap I uncover is an opportunity to learn. I’m constantly refining—not just my tooling, but my approach. I participate in CTFs, test detections in TryHackMe and HackTheBox labs, and study AI's role in defense as part of my doctoral work.</p>

      <p>Ultimately, Blue Teaming isn’t just my specialty — it’s my mindset. It’s how I think, how I train, and how I lead. I’m not chasing headlines. I’m building resilient, informed defenses that keep organizations and people safe when it matters most.</p>
