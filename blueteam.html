      <h2><span class="icon fa-shield"></span> Defense with Purpose</h2>
    </header>
    <p>Cybersecurity isn’t just about firewalls and logs — it’s about protecting people, systems, and mission-critical processes from real harm. My background in emergency response taught me that clarity, speed, and trust are essential under pressure. I bring that same mindset into every defensive engagement I lead.</p>

    <div class="box">
      <h4><span class="icon fa-envelope"></span> Email Security</h4>
      <p>I manage the full stack — from secure gateways to M365 hardening. I tune rulesets, enforce policies, and monitor mail flow behaviors to proactively detect impersonation and payload-based threats.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box">
      <h4><span class="icon fa-bug"></span> Phishing Defense</h4>
      <p>Dozens of phishing attempts cross my desk daily. I investigate payloads, verify compromise attempts, and educate users via customized simulation campaigns. Every click is a learning opportunity.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box">
      <h4><span class="icon fa-bolt"></span> Incident Response</h4>
      <p>From triage to containment, I respond to security events with structure and speed. I write IR documentation, facilitate tabletop exercises, and help bridge comms between technical and business teams.</p>
    </div>

    <blockquote>
      “My job isn’t just to block threats. It’s to understand them, tune out the noise, and build defenses that stand up to real pressure.”
    </blockquote>
      <h3>Tools in My Kit</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>SIEM:</strong> Alert tuning, custom rule creation, and correlation analysis</li>
        <li><strong>EDR/XDR:</strong> Investigation, containment, response workflow design</li>
        <li><strong>M365 Defender Suite:</strong> Email, endpoint, identity, and cloud app protection</li>
        <li><strong>Phishing Simulation:</strong> Custom campaigns and targeted user training</li>
        <li><strong>Threat Hunting:</strong> IOC correlation, pattern recognition, and proactive sweeps</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Always Improving</h3>
      <p>Every phishing ticket, every false positive, every gap I uncover is an opportunity to learn. I’m constantly refining—not just my tooling, but my approach. I participate in CTFs, test detections in TryHackMe and HackTheBox labs, and study AI's role in defense as part of my doctoral work.</p>

      <p>Ultimately, Blue Teaming isn’t just my specialty — it’s my mindset. It’s how I think, how I train, and how I lead. I’m not chasing headlines. I’m building resilient, informed defenses that keep organizations and people safe when it matters most.</p>
