      <h3><span class="icon fa-shield"></span> Defense With Purpose</h3>
      <p style="margin-top: -20px;">Cybersecurity isn‚Äôt just about firewalls and logs ‚Äî it‚Äôs about protecting people, systems, and mission-critical processes from real harm. My background in emergency response taught me that clarity, speed, and trust are essential under pressure. I bring that same mindset into every defensive engagement I lead.</p>

      <h3><span class="icon fa-envelope"></span> Email Security</h3>
      <p>I manage the full stack ‚Äî from secure gateways to M365 hardening. I tune rulesets, enforce policies, and monitor mail flow behaviors to proactively detect impersonation and payload-based threats.</p>

        <p>Real defense requires more than tools ‚Äî it demands precision, clarity, and calm during chaos. Here's how I respond when it counts.</p>

            <h4>üîó Credential Phishing Campaign</h4>
            <p>A multi-user phishing attempt triggered elevated login risk indicators in the cloud portal. I quickly isolated impacted users, reviewed login metadata, and escalated to MFA reset procedures. Forensics revealed a compromised third-party site was the lure vector. I updated allow/block rules, tuned detection, and led a company-wide awareness brief the next day.</p>

            <h4>üì© Insider Email Impersonation</h4>
            <p>A convincing spoof from a compromised external vendor attempted wire fraud. I investigated the headers, correlated it with prior delivery logs, and confirmed the malicious domain wasn't DMARC-compliant. I worked with IT to quarantine similar messages, added targeted rules, and directly contacted the impersonated user to stop the response chain.</p>

            <h4>‚öôÔ∏è OT/IT Segmentation Response</h4>
            <p>Suspicious scanning activity appeared on an IT asset adjacent to operational tech (OT). I validated the asset‚Äôs role, traced traffic through firewall logs, and confirmed it was a misconfigured monitoring job ‚Äî not malicious. I then advised controls to restrict OT exposure and drafted a long-term segmentation proposal to leadership.</p>

        <h3><span class="icon fa-compass"></span> Defensive Philosophy</h3>
        <p>At the core of every alert, investigation, or system change is a person who depends on us getting it right. That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt just build defenses ‚Äî I build trust.</p>
      </header>

      <p>My approach to cybersecurity is rooted in service. I protect systems because they power missions. I investigate incidents not just to find answers, but to ensure continuity, safety, and clarity for the people behind the screen. Whether I‚Äôm responding to a phishing escalation, tuning detection thresholds, or planning long-term controls, I treat each decision with purpose.</p>

      <p>Coming from emergency response and physical security, I know the cost of delay, the importance of clarity under pressure, and the difference it makes when someone shows up prepared. That mindset guides everything I do ‚Äî from email triage to architecture discussions to writing documentation that others can trust in a crisis.</p>

      <p>Defense isn't just a job. It's a discipline ‚Äî and a responsibility.</p>
