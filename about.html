        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm Brian Villanueva, a cybersecurity strategist and blue team lead with over 15 years of experience across cyber, physical security, and emergency response. My career has spanned hands-on incident response, threat hunting, infrastructure defense, and leading convergence efforts across security domains.</p>

        <p>I hold a master’s degree in cybersecurity and am pursuing a PhD in Information Security. I also maintain certifications such as CISSP, CISM, CASP+, CRTO (in progress), and more. My work focuses on securing critical infrastructure, building resilient detection systems, and using red team insights to inform defense strategies.</p>

        <p>Before cybersecurity, I served in physical security and EMS/firefighting roles. That real-world urgency shapes how I think about digital risk—always focused on reliability, response, and mission continuity.</p>

        <p>This site highlights my work, learning, and projects across the spectrum of cybersecurity operations. Feel free to explore and connect.</p>
