  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I'm Brian Villanueva, a cybersecurity strategist and blue team lead with 15+ years of experience across cyber, physical security, and emergency response. My journey includes protecting critical infrastructure, leading threat detection initiatives, and bridging the gap between offensive testing and defensive architecture.</p>

  <p>My certifications include CISSP, CISM, CASP+, and CRTO (in progress). I hold a master’s degree in cybersecurity, and I’m currently pursuing a PhD in Information Security, with a research focus on AI applications in infrastructure defense.</p>

  <p>With a background in firefighting, EMS, and physical security, I approach cyber defense through the lens of real-world risk, urgency, and mission continuity. I build defenses with purpose—and teach others to do the same.</p>
