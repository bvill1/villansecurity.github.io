          <h3>Professional Background</h3>
          <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="Brian speaking at a cybersecurity conference" /></span>My career spans emergency services, physical security, and cybersecurity—driven by adaptability and real-world mission focus. Starting as a certified Illinois Firefighter and EMT, I thrived in high-pressure environments, mastering critical thinking and decision-making when lives were on the line. As a Basic Life Support Instructor, I empowered others by teaching life-saving skills, and in physical security management, I developed and implemented policies that enhanced safety and operational resilience.</p>

          <p>Transitioning to cybersecurity, I have combined my multidisciplinary background with technical expertise to address evolving security challenges. My certifications and on-going education reflect my commitment to ongoing learning and excellence. Actively engaged in practical labs like TryHackMe and HackTheBox, I specialize in incident response, ethical hacking, and cyberdefense strategies.</p>

          <h3>Vision and Aspirations</h3>
          <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="Brian with colleagues at DEF CON" /></span>With a future-focused mindset, I aim to shape security at the intersection of people, policy, and technology. Currently pursuing a PhD in Information Technology with a focus on AI and Information Security, I am passionate about merging cutting-edge research with hands-on experience. My vision is to advance security programs that bridge the gap between cybersecurity and physical security, ensuring a holistic approach to organizational defense. By leveraging AI and emerging technologies, I aim to tackle tomorrow’s threats while building resilient systems that adapt to today’s complex environments.</p>

          <h3>Personal Insights</h3>
          <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="Brian with family" /></span>At the heart of everything I do is my family. Since 2013, I’ve been fortunate to share my life with my wife, my best friend and unwavering partner in every endeavor. Together, we’re raising two incredible children and are in the process of adopting our niece and nephew, creating a dynamic and loving home.</p>

          <p>In May 2023, I faced the profound loss of my mother, a three-time cancer survivor whose resilience and strength continue to inspire me. Her legacy drives my commitment to create a safe and nurturing world for my children, motivating me to combine my professional skills with personal values in meaningful ways.</p>
          <p>Ultimately, I strive to lead with integrity—blending tactical experience and strategic vision to create safer, more resilient systems for the world my family will inherit.</p>
