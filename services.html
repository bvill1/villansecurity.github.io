        <h2>Virtual CISO, built for small teams</h2>
        <p>
          Fractional security leadership for organizations that need clarity, prioritization, and defensible decisions
          without hiring a full-time CISO.
        </p>
      </header>

      <div class="content">

        <h3>What you get</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Program ownership</strong> with a clear operating model: decisions, prioritization, and accountability.</li>
          <li><strong>Risk visibility</strong> through leadership-ready reporting grounded in evidence and business impact.</li>
          <li><strong>Executable roadmap</strong> aligned to budget, staffing, and real constraints.</li>
          <li><strong>Vendor and tool rationalization</strong> to reduce waste and clarify what is delivering value.</li>
          <li><strong>Incident readiness</strong> through escalation paths, tabletop exercises, and minimum viable response planning.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Engagement model</h3>
        <p>
          Engagements are structured and outcome-driven, not open-ended consulting.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Working cadence:</strong> weekly or monthly working sessions with key stakeholders.</li>
          <li><strong>Asynchronous support:</strong> quick decisions, policy review, and security questionnaire support.</li>
          <li><strong>Monthly executive brief:</strong> risk, progress, and decisions required.</li>
          <li><strong>Quarterly roadmap refresh:</strong> adjusts for business changes, threat changes, and constraints.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>30-day onboarding</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Week 1:</strong> Discovery, goals, constraints, and current-state inventory.</li>
          <li><strong>Week 2:</strong> Risk register draft and control posture snapshot.</li>
          <li><strong>Week 3:</strong> Prioritized roadmap and operating cadence established.</li>
          <li><strong>Week 4:</strong> Executive brief delivered and steady-state execution begins.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Engagement tiers</h3>

        <h4>Foundation vCISO</h4>
        <p><em>Best for organizations that need structure and leadership cadence.</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Monthly executive brief (risk and progress)</li>
          <li>Risk register and top-priority roadmap</li>
          <li>Minimum viable policy and standards baseline</li>
          <li>One working session per month</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Core vCISO</h4>
        <p><em>Best for organizations actively executing a security roadmap.</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Everything in Foundation</li>
          <li>Weekly working session</li>
          <li>Roadmap management and decision support</li>
          <li>Vendor review and tool rationalization guidance</li>
          <li>Incident readiness: escalation model, tabletop planning, and minimum viable IR runbook</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Core Plus vCISO</h4>
        <p><em>Best for regulated or audit-driven organizations that need stronger evidence and governance.</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Everything in Core</li>
          <li>Control evidence strategy and audit readiness support</li>
          <li>Third-party risk program starter kit (intake, scoring, minimum due diligence)</li>
          <li>Security metrics design: what to measure, how to report it, and what decisions it supports</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Pricing depends on scope and complexity. If the fit is wrong, I will say so.
        </p>

        <h3>Who this is for</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Organizations with IT leadership but no dedicated security leadership</li>
          <li>Teams under audit, insurance scrutiny, or customer questionnaire pressure</li>
          <li>Organizations that need governance and prioritization, not more tools</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Who this is not for</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Organizations seeking 24/7 SOC coverage or managed detection services</li>
          <li>Checkbox compliance without risk ownership</li>
          <li>Teams requiring a full-time, on-site CISO</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Common outcomes after 90 days</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Clear top risks with owners and an executable roadmap</li>
          <li>Leadership reporting that supports prioritization instead of panic</li>
          <li>Policies and standards that are used, not shelfware</li>
          <li>Incident response readiness that is executable under pressure</li>
        </ul>
