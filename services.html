  <h3>Virtual CISO, built for small teams</h3>
  <p>
    Villan Security provides virtual CISO (vCISO) leadership to help you run a practical security program,
    communicate risk to leadership, and build a roadmap that survives audits, incidents, and budget pressure.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have tools and good people but no consistent governance, this is for you.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>What you get</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Program ownership</strong> with a clear operating model: decisions, prioritization, and accountability.</li>
    <li><strong>Risk visibility</strong> with leadership-ready reporting grounded in evidence and business impact.</li>
    <li><strong>Roadmap execution support</strong> that translates policy and frameworks into usable work.</li>
    <li><strong>Vendor and tool rationalization</strong> to reduce waste and clarify what is delivering value.</li>
    <li><strong>Incident readiness</strong> through tabletop exercises, escalation paths, and minimum viable response planning.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Engagement model</h3>
  <p>You get a consistent cadence and defined outputs, not open-ended consulting.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Weekly working session</strong> (30 to 60 minutes) with key stakeholders.</li>
    <li><strong>Asynchronous support</strong> via email or chat for quick decisions and review.</li>
    <li><strong>Monthly executive brief</strong> summarizing risk, progress, and decisions needed.</li>
    <li><strong>Quarterly roadmap refresh</strong> based on business changes, threat changes, and constraints.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>30-day onboarding</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Week 1:</strong> Discovery, goals, constraints, and current-state inventory.</li>
    <li><strong>Week 2:</strong> Risk register draft and control posture snapshot.</li>
    <li><strong>Week 3:</strong> Prioritized roadmap and operating cadence established.</li>
    <li><strong>Week 4:</strong> Executive brief delivered, then steady-state execution begins.</li>
