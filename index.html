    <h2>Brian Villanueva</h2>
    <p>Strategic Cybersecurity Advisor | Blue Team Architect | XAI Researcher
I help organizations cut through alert noise, converge physical and digital defense, and make risk understandable.</p>
<p>From field triage to threat triage, I’ve always been called to protect what matters.</p>

      <h2>Purpose-Driven Cybersecurity</h2>
      <p>I bring frontline experience, converged thinking, and adversary-aware strategy to every engagement.
My goal isn’t just to stop threats but to build defenders and cultures who understand them.
Because true security comes from clarity, not just controls.</p>

      <h2>From Boots to Blue Team</h2>
      <p>I started my career stabilizing emergencies in the field, now I do the same in cyberspace. My wife once said I went from fixing broken people to fixing broken systems, and she’s not wrong. Whether the threat is physical or digital, my mission is the same: protect, contain, and restore with urgency and clarity.</p>

      <h2>Hands-On, Always Learning</h2>
      <p>Active in threat simulation platforms like TryHackMe and HackTheBox, I stay sharp by exploring both red and blue methodologies. From phishing analysis to custom detections, I believe defenders must train like attackers to stay ahead of the curve.</p>

      <h2>Security With Purpose</h2>
      <p>Cybersecurity isn't just a career — it’s a responsibility. I build defenses not just for compliance, but for real-world impact. Every decision I make is rooted in protecting the systems we all rely on — for the world my family will inherit tomorrow.</p>
